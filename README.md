Topic: Code Obfuscation

## Overview
Code Obfuscation is a method of hiding code in such a way that it can't a) be decomplied, or b)is very hard to parse through.
There are multiple different ways to obfuscate code: String Encryption, Rename Obfuscation, Aggregation Obfuscation, Storage Obfuscation, Control Obfuscation, and Debug Obfuscation.

  String Encryption - encrypt the string within the code and decrypt at runtime

  Rename Obfuscation - rename variables and functions to unrelated words

  Aggregation Obfuscation - Split a single array into smaller subarrays

  Storage Obfuscation - Storing variables globally versus locally

  Control Obfuscation - Messing with the flow of the code to throw people off track(code that leads to nowhere)

  Debug Obfuscation - Removing Debug lines and preventing error messages from leaking to users

It is also possible to combine the different ways to obfuscate code.
There are programs that are dedicated to help programmers with obfuscating code such as ProGuard, DexGuard, and JavaGuard.
There are also tournaments that are centered around obfuscation, one of which is the International Obfuscated C Code Contest.
