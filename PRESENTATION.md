# Code Obfuscation

## Overview
Code obfuscation is a system in which normal, human-readable code is made more difficult to understand. The code should still function in exactly the same way pre- and post-obfuscation, but obfuscation should make code significantly harder to read.

There are multiple reasons to obfuscate code:
- Protect intellectual property: in the case of open-source code and projects, people might want to conceal their ideas to prevent them from being stolen and incorporated into other projects. To do this, code is obfuscated so that the ideas can't be copied. For instance, if a programmer wanted to publish a password cracker but didn't want their software to be stolen, they could run it through an obfuscator so that nobody could understand the process by which they go about password cracking.
- Hide malicious code: Hackers and cyber criminals use code obfuscation to make malicious code seem harmless or useless. They hide their viruses and malware in seemingly passive code so that malware detection devices don't detect it.
- For fun!: People obfuscate code for their own amusement or to make a sort of puzzle for how to crack the obfuscated code. There are even obfuscation contests where participants try to make creative projects that are impossible to understand. We'll talk a little more about this later!
